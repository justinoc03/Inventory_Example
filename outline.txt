Objective: Program that will help an oddities store search their inventory.
Input: Size (small, med, large), color (purple, orange, black, red, blue, green, fuchsia, mermaid treasure)

output: text of anything in stock that fits description

version plan:
check inventory for a match on size and color

versioning plan:
X 1. handshake between js and html (sourcing)
X 2. get user selection on button click (onclick tag on button element in HTML that runs a function in JS)
X 3. select size (select element with options within)
4. select color
5. search by size
6. search by color
7. search by both size and color

check if we have something in a given size
check inventory for a match on size and color (nested ifs)

Should we use multiple inputs (variables) or use a single big one?
  generally it is easier to use multiple variables for a few reasons:
    1. easier to adjust later
    2. keeps code cleaner and easier to understand
